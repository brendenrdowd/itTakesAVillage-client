### Summary

It Takes a Village is a community based altruism application that lets users notify their community that they are in need of assistance, be it food, clothing, transportation, etc. A user can post a story explaining what kind of help they are in need of, and other users in their real world "community" (based off geo-location proximity) can indicate whether they are able to provide aid, or can share to others in their off-app communities that might be able to help.
